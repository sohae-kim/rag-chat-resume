        "content": "Hi, I'm Sohae Kim. I'm currently seeking a career opportunity in machine learning and data science near Arlington, VA or remote. I'm a Staff Engineer at Samsung Display, currently on leave to support my family relocated in the United States. At Samsung Display, I led the development of ML-based systems for materials discovery and analysis. My responsibilities at Samsung Display were equivalent to those of a Research Scientist or Data Scientist in the current US industry. I am open to similar positions as well as Machine Learning Engineer. Before Samsung Display, I investigated nanoscale interface of semiconductors computationally in the department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT for my PhD and studied Mechanical Engineering at KAIST for my master's and bachelor's degrees. I have always been intrigued by computational approaches to solve problems in science and engineering and enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve problems.",

        "content": "ML-Assisted Materials Discovery for OLED: Led the development and deployment of ML-assisted systems for OLED materials discovery. This platform combines ML-based property prediction with systematic validation frameworks to accelerate materials discovery process. Traditional discovery of promising OLED molecules relies heavily on researchers' existing knowledge, limiting their ability to navigate through billions of potential molecular candidates. With this system, researchers could quickly identify promising candidates, receive recommendations for similar molecules, and significantly reduce experimental costs. I advanced the maturity of ML models for property prediction and led the development and deployment of various modules including the high-throughput screening system and recommendation system.Transformed materials discovery efficiency: Increased the precision in identifying viable OLED materials from 22% to 48% through ML-based screening. Further improved precision to 66% with advanced ML-predictability criteria. Enabled systematic exploration of 1.5M+ candidate molecules per structure type. Advanced technical excellence: Developed highly accurate ML models achieving RMSE values as low as 0.025eV for key molecular properties. Created novel ML-predictability scale for quantitative reliability assessment. Deployed system on internal web platform for organization-wide access. Demonstrated research leadership: Published findings in industry proceedings and presented at technical conferences. Established framework for continuous ML model improvement through iterative database expansion. Developed ensemble ML models combining linear, non-linear, and artificial neural network approaches using Scikit-learn and Keras. Implemented comprehensive property prediction for multiple electronic states including HOMO, LUMO, triplet states ( T₁, ³MLCT, ³MC) for phosphors, and singlet/triplet excited states for TADF materials. Achieved exceptional prediction accuracy with average RMSEs of 0.025-0.043eV for key electronic properties. Utilized hyperparameter optimization techniques including random search and Bayesian optimization. Implemented t-SNE mapping for visualization of chemical space and similarity analysis. Created automated validation pipelines integrating ML predictions with DFT calculations for final verification.",

        "content": "Data Mining and Predictive Modeling for LCA Outcome: Developed predictive models for labor condition application (LCA) certification outcomes - a prerequisite first step in the United States professional work visa petition process including those for H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 visas. This data mining project aimed to help visa applicants, sponsoring companies, and immigration lawyers better understand certification likelihood and key success factors. By analyzing data from the United States DOLETA's OFLC website, the project created predictive models to assess LCA applications before submission and identified crucial factors influencing certification decisions. Received an A+ grade for the final and an A grade overall. Through data processing and exploration, discovered critical application requirements: Wage units must be consistent between proposed and prevailing wage fields. Proposed wage rate must meet or exceed the prevailing wage for certification consideration. Classification tree analysis revealed several factors that increase certification likelihood: H-1B dependent employer status. Presence of agent representing employer. Use of OES (Occupational Employment Statistics) as prevailing wage source. Higher frequency of applications from the employer. Model Performance: Classification trees achieved best accuracy (75-77%) on balanced datasets. Outperformed baseline models and other machine learning approaches. Demonstrated effective prediction capability while maintaining interpretability. Data Processing Insights: Working directly with raw DOLETA data revealed crucial insights not available in pre-processed datasets. Hands-on data cleaning exposed nuanced patterns in wage reporting and application preparation. Direct processing of source data enabled discovery of subtle relationships between certification success and application quality. Data Processing & Engineering: Developed robust preprocessing pipeline for wage normalization and unit standardization. Created two approaches for categorical variables: dummy encoding and frequency-based transformation. Implemented systematic outlier detection and handling procedures. Model Development: Implemented four classification methods: decision trees, logistic regression, k-NN, and neural networks. Used 50/25/25 split for training, validation, and testing with cross-validation. Created both balanced and unbalanced dataset approaches to handle class imbalance. Evaluation Framework: Developed two baseline models: all-certified prediction and wage-based rules. Created comprehensive evaluation metrics comparing model performance. Implemented detailed error analysis to understand prediction failures. Tech Stack: R programming with rpart, neuralnet, caret libraries. Custom functions for data processing and model evaluation. Statistical analysis tools for result validation.",
